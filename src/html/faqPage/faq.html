            <p>
              Performance marketing is a general term for any kind of online
              marketing where advertisers spend their budgets through specific
              channels and pay only when a required action is completed, such as
              sales, clicks, or leads.
            </p>

            <p>
              Affiliate - or partner - marketing is one of the most common forms
              of performance marketing. It relies on the model where individuals
              or commercial affiliates or partners promote specific products or
              services by creating affiliate links, usually smartlinks, or
              campaigns. These links allow performance tracking platforms to
              redirect traffic to the correct offer without wasting it.

            There are many players out there who claim they have a Smartlink.

            <p>
              At UCLIQ, we aim to stay as close to the literary sense as
              possible. Our smartlinks use machine learning algorithms to
              maximize ROI for our clients and constantly learn new patterns and
              ways to increase KPI for the traffic.
            </p>

            <p>So how exactly do they work?</p>

            <p>
              Smartlinks allow access to a set of different offers through the
              same tracking link, using the domain name selected by the
              publisher. An actual selection of offers are made by the AI-driven
              Traffic Delivery System that takes into account the following
              parameters and rules:
            </p>

            <ul class="faq__list-mb">
              <li>
                <span> Type of traffic </span> (Email, Social, Chat, Mediabuy,
                etc.) - offers may permit only a certain type of traffic
              </li>

              <li>
                <span> Geo-location </span> offers may permit traffic only
                from specific countries or explicitly deny traffic from specific
                countries
              </li>

              <li>
                <span> Publisher reputation </span> some offers may be only
                accessible for publishers with higher reputation
              </li>

              <li>
                <span> Offer daily cap </span> UCLIQ calculates caps as a
                24-hour rolling window and prevents sending traffic to offers
                that have cap already filled
              </li>

              <li>
                <span> Repeated clicks </span> UCLIQ notices if an offer has
                multiple clicks from the same IP address and prevents multiple
                registrations from the same IP
              </li>

              <li>
                <span> Constant optimization </span> UCLIQ AI constantly
                learns how to efficiently monetize all types of traffic and find
                the offer that will maximize return for the publisher and the
                network. Also, AI takes into consideration peculiar properties
                of the traffic sent by a specific publisher and a sub-source,
                with only 100 clicks needed to explore the offer EPC and
                optimize it
              </li>
            </ul>
              <p>
                Alongside with fully-automatic AI-driven smartlinks, UCLIQ
                offers managed smartlinks and tracking links to individual
                offers, allowing clients to fine-tune their funnels manually if
                they have a specific need to do so.

              Unlike many other API-based services, UCLIQ has access to all
              data, including impressions, clicks, conversions, and declines,
              enabling it to analyze patterns and detect fraud at multiple
              levels. In detail, our Fraud Detection suite:
            </p>
            <ul class="faq__list-mb">
              <li>
                 Implements the immediate analysis of the data with no delay
                for the click and no negative collisions, ensuring a smooth
                process leading to higher conversion rates
              </li>

              <li>
                 Detects probable bot traffic by constantly analyzing IP
                addresses and device fingerprint patterns, including emulator
                detection, known botnets, subnets, and others
              </li>

              <li>
                 Detects probable fraud from publishers that access a platform
                from multiple devices and hide behind proxies or VPNs, as well
                as share accounts between numerous persons and groups
              </li>

              <li>
                 Detects motivated traffic by analyzing sources, IP addresses,
                and device fingerprints from multiple publishers coming to the
                same offers
              </li>

              <li>
                 Detects traffic coming from emulators or faking geos, device
                types, languages, time zones, and others
              </li>

              <li>
                 Detects multiple clicks and conversions from the same IP
                addresses and same device fingerprints
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              At the conversion level, UCLIQ analyzes multiple patterns and
              profiles them by assigning a specific risk score. Clients can set
              up numerous automated filters, allowing the system to flag
              suspicious conversions and put them on hold for further review.
            </p>

            What is a Private CDN and how can my business benefit from it?

            <p>
              CDN stands for a content delivery network, which is a
              geographically distributed group of servers that work together to
              provide fast Internet content delivery.
            </p>

            <p>
              A CDN allows to quickly transfer the assets needed for loading
              Internet content, including HTML pages, javascript files,
              stylesheets, images, and videos. A CDN significantly improves
              loading times for pre-lands and landing pages, resulting in better
              traffic delivery and conversion rates.
            </p>

            <p>
              Another advantage of a CDN is increasing content availability and
              redundancy that operate as a load balancing and a failover
              service. It provides better service availability and better
              protection in case of DDOS or other service attacks.

              We bill clients on a monthly basis. There is no lock-up period or
              pay-upfront period, and you may choose not to renew your
              subscription. Besides, you have our no-question-asked money-back
              guarantee if you feel that our platform hasn't met your
              expectations.

              Indeed, moving large amounts of data can be time-consuming.
              However, we do our best to make the transition process as smooth
              as possible. Typically, all processes are transitioning gradually.
              Initially, only new publishers are onboarded onto the UCLIQ
              platform and only actual offers are configured. The second step
              implies the transition of the existing publishers, however you
              will still have access to historical data on the old platform.
              Finally, the old platform is phased out with historical reports
              stored for reconciliation.

              It is vitally important to maintain healthy domain names, valid
              SSL certificates, and a balanced name server cloud to ensure no
              traffic leakage, abuse reports, or general nameserver
              unavailability.
            </p>
            <p>
              We resolve all these problems by a private Domain Name Management
              System that operates dozens of nameservers, automatic SSL
              certificate issuance tools, and smartlink domain name load
              balancing
            </p>
            <p>
              These features allow our clients to significantly reduce traffic
              loss or other possible damages.
